            <!-- Bio Section 1 -->
            <p class="bio-text">
                I come from a family of seven, and as the middle child, I learned early how to listen, adapt, and find
                my place in a busy environment. Growing up, I spent a large part of my childhood living abroad in Japan
                and China from ages 7 to 14. Those years shaped how I see the world — being immersed in different
                cultures at a young age taught me independence, curiosity, and an appreciation for perspectives beyond
                my own.

            <!-- Bio Section 2 -->
            <p class="bio-text">
                I graduated from U of D Jesuit in 2021 and began my college journey at Henry Ford College, where I
                attended from 2021 to 2023. During my time there, I played baseball and served as team captain in my
                second year, an experience that strengthened my leadership skills and reinforced the importance of
                accountability and teamwork. I also earned my associate’s degree in General Studies, which gave me a
                broad academic foundation and the confidence to take on more challenging work.
            </p>

            <!-- Bio Section 3 -->
            <p class="bio-text">
                In 2023, I transferred to the University of Michigan to pursue a degree in Data Science. Since then,
                I’ve focused on building systems that turn real-world data into meaningful insights, combining technical
                rigor with practical application. My background — spanning different countries, teams, and academic
                paths — has shaped how I approach problems: thoughtfully, collaboratively, and with a long-term mindset.
