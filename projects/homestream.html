    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Homestream is an AI-powered real estate analysis platform built to help investors evaluate potential deals
      quickly, clearly, and with confidence. It aggregates property, market, and financial data into a single structured
      view, replacing intuition-driven decisions with transparent, data-backed insights. By automating key steps like
      deal screening, pricing analysis, and investment scoring, Homestream reduces friction in the early stages of due
      diligence and allows investors to focus on the opportunities that truly matter. The platform is designed with
      scalability in mind, enabling both individual investors and teams to make smarter, faster decisions as they grow.
    </p>

    <h3>Why We Built It</h3>
    <p>
      My co-founder and I built Homestream as a long-term tool we plan to use in the future. As a data science major
      with ambitions to build a large, geographically diverse real estate portfolio, I wanted a system that could scale
      with both my technical skills and investment goals over time. Growing up, I spent long periods living abroad, and
      when I returned home for summers my family would travel across the U.S., visiting different states—those
      experiences shaped a long-standing goal of owning property in every state. Homestream is my way of turning that
      vision into something practical: a data-driven framework I can rely on as I evaluate markets, manage risk, and
      make smarter decisions as my portfolio grows.
    </p>

    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>From a technical perspective, Homestream is built around cost-efficient data ingestion, API integration, and
      analytical modeling. I was responsible for sourcing and evaluating third-party APIs that provided reliable
      property, market, and financial data while remaining economically viable at scale, with a focus on selecting
      datasets that could be meaningfully contrasted against a user’s existing technology stack. Using this data, I
      designed and implemented calculations for key investment metrics such as estimated rehabilitation costs and deal
      viability scores. Throughout development, I engaged directly with multiple API providers through exploratory and
      technical calls to assess data quality, coverage, pricing models, and long-term scalability before integration.

    <h3>Milestones</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Semifinalist in 2025 University of Michigan Business Challenge</li>
      <li>Individually raised 25k in non-dilutive funding toward the project</li>
      <li>2025 Ann Arbor Spark Clients</li>
      <li>2025 University of Michigan Dare To Dream Phase III</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>My Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>After spending over 12 hours in various user-tests, I learned the importance of iterative design and user feedback in refining product features.</li>
      <li>I spend two months cold messaging potential users to build a list of 50+ beta testers - I learned the value of direct engagement and building relationships with potential users.</li>
      <li>Development is NOT linear. We must've pivoted a dozen times because things failed, APIs got too expensive, or we realized we were reinventing the wheel.</li>
      <li>I'm skilled at explaining complex technical concepts in simple terms to non-technical stakeholders - this is something I hope to continue improving.</li>
    </ul>
